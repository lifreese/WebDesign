<h> Assignment 1: Short Reflection </h>

<p> On my original site, I got no critique, just positive feedback to keep doin' what I'm doin'! Which was nice,
but I really wanted to get cooking on this revised site. I decided because the feedback was positive on the last site, 
to start over and try something a bit more complicated.</p>
<p> So, I came up with a whole new concept! Games from my childhood! I thought that could be fun for me to write about
and fun for folks to read about because everybody loves nostalgia right? So, I picked four games, wrote about em', wrote and intro paragraph,
figured out how to format images so that they would be on one side of the screen and the text on the other side (which took forever by the way 
I had to just muck around with the placement until it worked lol), make sure the images were sized right and accessible through the file structure,
AND make sure that everything looked ok visually and was readable. I went for a brown color scheme to evoke a sense of coziness in the viewer
as well as choosing a color easy for the eyes to process. I wanted to do more than 4 games, but once I got past h6, the header system wouldn't work 
anymore and I couldn't figure out how to fix it.</p>
