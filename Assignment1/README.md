# Our Share of Night

## A Novel by Mariana Enriquez

Our Share of Night is horror story set over many generations of one family with supernatural powers and their efforts to escape the control of an evil cult.
The best thing about this book is the rich characters and the detailed setting and history of Argentina that weaves them all together. The book is split into
substories that all connect into the main narrative. Each story is unique in its own way and is headed with a drawing as well as a title. I would recommend
this book to anyone with a strong stomach and an interest in cult dynamics, complicated family ties, and Argentinian history.
Thank's for reading!
