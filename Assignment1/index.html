<h1>Like Water For Chocolate</h1>
<h2>A Novel by Laura Esquirel</h2> 
  <p></p>
</body>


Like Water for Chocolate is one of the all time greats in my opinion. Rich, magical realism about love, food, family and the passage of time.
The story follows a Mexican ranch family, specifically that of Tita, the youngest daughter who is required by family tradition to never
find love or leave the home and whose only duty is to take care of her mama Elena in her old age. This is a horrible fate for Tita, 
especially when she falls in love and her mama arranges for her older sister to marry her love instead of her. Drama, as you can imagine,
ensues. I'm not one for romance, but the way Laura Esquirel captures yearning and resentment so well in this book broke through to me and
now this is one of my favorite reads. The writing itself is almost lyrical. Also the focus on food for each chapter is mouth watering.
The emotion this story captures over such a short page count is truly impressive. It deserves all the praise it receives and more.
<h3>Recommended Drink for Reading</h3>
I'd recommend, if you are over the legal drinking age, a delicious Espresso Martini to pair with your reading experience! 
The rich, dark espresso and velvety coffee liqueur paired with a dash of sweetness reflects the sensual mood of the story.
Throw a few coffee beans on top to add some bitter crunch for garnish and you will be all set to dive into Tita's world!
<h4>Best time of year to read</h4>
I'd recommend reading during the hot, muggy summer months of July or August! An excellent beach read,
this story reads quickly and is easy to consume in one to two sittings! Whether stretched out on the sand or lounging in the cooler
evenings while listening to the crickets sing, summer is the best time to read this work!
