Hello!

Here is the finished version of my sites! Woooohoooooo!!!

I had a really fun time with these! I missed coding in html and have been enjoying myself a lot!
Especially getting to write about stuff that I'm passionate about makes me look forward to each weeks assignment!
I am having trouble getting Figma to load, it keeps crashing on my laptop. I'll try it on my desktop and see if that
makes a difference. 

Thanks for reading!
