        <h2>--- My History with Games: An Introduction---</h2>
    </div>

  <img src="images/IE-003_apple.jpg" alt="Macintosh Gumdrop Computer"><p>When I was a kid, computers were at a point of becoming mainstays both in school
  and at home. The Apple Macintosh was king and every kid loved walking down to computer
  lab during the school week. The internet was slow and off limits to us kids. So what did 
  we have when boredom came a knockin? COMPUTER GAMES! On this page, I've created a mini repository of old games that I loved to play as a child. Now to specify, I won't be speaking on 
  browser games, RIP Adobe Flash, but rather games that came on these things called CD ROMS.
  Also, due to time constraints, I will only be discussing four of the games that I would consider
  core to my early gaming experience. Those games are, 'Zoo Tycoon,' 'Secrets of DaVinci; The Forbidden Manuscript,'
  'Marble Blast! Gold,' and 'Bugdom.'
  Did you play any of these? Let's head down memory lane and take a walk together!
  </p>

<!-- Zoo Tycoon --> 

    <div class="subheader">

        <h3> -Zoo Tycoon-</h3>

    </div>

    <img src= "images/zootycoon.webp" alt="Zoo Tycoon Menu"><p>
    From the creators of Roller Coaster Tycoon comes Zoo Tycoon! The business simulator that has 
  you running a zoo! Build exhibits, keep animals happy, make money, make guests happy (or drop them into the lion enclosure!)
  Anything is possible in Zoo Tycoon!!!  With two expansions, an aquarium expansion 'Marine Mania' and dinosaur expansion 'Dinosaur Digs,' 
  the sky is the limit! Zoo Tycoon has a heavy focus on design aesthetics as well as money management and animal education.
  This game is the only reason I know the difference between different types of terrains and foliage. This game is not limited
  my fact. If you want, you can have a few mythical creatures as well including Yetis, Bigfoots (Bigfeets?), Mermaids and
  Unicorns. The art style is charming, the UI is easy to understand and navigate, and the game is entertaining throughout!
  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a port of this game for modern hardware as of yet.

<!-- Secrets of DaVinci --> 

    <div class="subheader">
 
        <h4> -Secret's of DaVinci: The Forbiden Manuscript-</h4>
    
    </div>


  <img src= "images/4881.jpg" alt="Secrets of Davinci CD ROM Cover">
  <p> There's nothing like a little point and click mystery adventure game to keep the mind entertained! You play as Valdo,
    a young and ambitious man who has been invited to Cloux Manor to look for a rumored manuscript written and then
    hidden by it's former owner, Leonardo DaVinci. This beautifully rendered puzzle game stands out to me most
    because of it's amazing design. The 3d rendered environments are richly 
    textured, historically accurate, and beautifully lit. The puzzles are challenging, although not impossible so, 
    and the story is engaging and keeps the player hooked. Secret passage ways, old flying machines, counterfeit paintings,
    characters with secrets, and a beautiful manor to explore await in Secrets of DaVinci; the Forbidden Manuscript.
    Unfortunately, the only version of this game I have found is unplayable due to glitches and bugs. We need a 
    port of this game to modern hardware ASAP!

<!-- Marble Blast Gold --> 

    <div class="subheader">

        <h5> -Marble Blast Gold!-</h5>

    </div>

  <img src="images/ScreenShot2023-01-20at8.55.14PM.png"><p> The second that funky electronic theme song
    starts to play, you know you're in for a treat. You play as, you guessed it, a marble, trying to complete various timed 
    courses to get to the next level. Using WASD to roll, space to hop, and mouse click to use powerups, you can cruise
    right along through the trials. Or can you? Some of these levels get pretty challenging with the inclusion of hazards
    like landmines, tornados, slippery mud, super thin tracks, and huge fans, all looking to throw you off your game
    and ruin your run. This game is awesome for all ages and has been ported to new harware! Will you dare to complete
    in this marble death trap? Of course you will!

<!-- Bugdom --> 

    <div class="subheader">

        <h6> -Bugdom- </h6>

    </div>

  <img src= "images/s9pCeP.jpg" alt="Bugdom CD ROM Case"><p> Oh my goodness is this game cute.
    You play as Rollie McFly, a roly poly bug wearing chunky sneakers, as he goes on a quest to rescue
    imprisoned ladybugs, wearing pink high heels naturally, from the evil fire ant empire! If there's 
    anything to be said about Bugdom it's that it's incredibly creative in it's level design. From a pond
    where you hop from lily pad to lily pad trying to not get your blood sucked by little mosquitos,
    also wearing sneakers by the way, to a dense, claustrophobic honey hive filled with angry bees, to a backyard
    where you have to avoid getting stomped on by oblivious humans and ride dragonflies like fighter planes, this 
    game undoubtedly gets the most out of it's bug theme. The music is also incredible, with each level having its
    own theme that perfectly represents its vibe. The controls are a bit stilted, but that's to be expected. This was
    the first computer game I ever beat. Yep! All 12, honestly pretty difficult after level 3, levels. This ones pretty freakin 
    awesome! Check it out if you can, I believe there are fan ports of it.
