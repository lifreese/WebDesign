<!--Listed Resources-->
<div class="directory">
  <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> is worth a look to see if someone has made an old game playable! 
          For example, here's an updated version of <a href="https://jorio.itch.io/bugdom">Bugdom!</a>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.myabandonware.com/ ">My Abandonware</a> is a great resource to find old games to play.
          However, it should be noted that these will take a little more installation set up on your end as opposed to itch.io's 
          runnable files.
          For example, here's a playable version of <a href="https://www.myabandonware.com/game/zoo-tycoon-complete-collection-dzx">Zoo Tycoon!</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="https://gamehistory.org/">The Video Game History Foundation</a> is a digital library of gaming media, think magazines etc.
          While I haven't been able to find any playable games, you can still read up on them or look at their source code!

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RagnarRoxShow">RagnarRox</a> is a content creator who focuses primarily on mostly unknown horror games.
      He frequently plays writes his video essays about games that are hard to get your hands on. I'd recommend his videos on 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3yGE_VHN4M&t=14s">Rule of Rose</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGRQpgY3QPU">Kuon</a>
      to get you started!
    </li>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OneShortEye/videos">One Short Eye</a> is a creator who focuses on games from the 80s and 90s. Part walkthrough, 
      part behind the scenes fun, what I enjoy about his content is that he frequently goes into the source code of the games to point out how the mechanics 
      work for the viewer. I'd recommend his video on
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSODB1CRez0">The Dagger of Amon Ra.</a>
    <li>
      Lastly, I'd recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PowerPakGames">Power Pak</a>. Although he doesn't focus on older games like the other recomendations, Power Pak releases content 
      about a lot of interesting indie projects releasing. I'd recommend his video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D55fuKfEEG8">Proximate</a>, which we talked about on the <a href="About.html">About</a> page.
      I'd also recommend his video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-qaFjqJuQ4&t=4561s">Vile</a>, for a look at an impressive game and some information about Steam sensorship.
